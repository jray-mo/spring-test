Creating generic repository:
  a. Should include the ability to get by Id, get all table entries
  b. Use getClass method to get the type of object we need to work with?
  c. Repository classes may contain specific methods for type of entity, but
  must inherit base repository class.
  d. Base repository class just needs to return generic objects based off Id or
  whole table (possibly other params).
